Welcome to FarmNet Project. Currently it is in Demo right now and is going to soon be able to be open source and given out 
for you to use and contribute to the project.

FarmNet is a system to help you view your farm outside of the game.This read only tool allows you to monitor your farm 
as users are logged in and working. This software is for Farming Simulator 2017.

I am looking for people to help with this project or that would like to work together to get something good out of what I 
have already done. 

This software is AS-IS and if you need anything let me know. This is Aplha and not cleaned up at all. 

Install Steps:
1. You just upload to your site 
2. I every page you need to set your xml from your dedi box
